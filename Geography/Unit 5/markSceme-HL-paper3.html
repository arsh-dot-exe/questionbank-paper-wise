<p><em>Marks should be allocated according to the paper 3 part A markbands</em>. <em>These can be found under the “Your tests” tab &gt; supplemental materials. </em></p>
<p>Transboundary pollution may be a short-lived event or more pervasive problem involving movements of polluted bodies of air or water across national boundaries.</p>
<p>Possible themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scale may vary from relatively localized issues affecting border areas, <em>eg</em> transboundary aquifers, to problems affecting entire world regions, <em>eg</em> smoke from forest fires in Indonesia affecting southeast Asia.</li>
<li>Some pollution events have global-scale impacts, <em>eg</em> Fukuyama isotopes crossing the Pacific.</li>
<li>Acid rain is a commonly occurring issue.</li>
<li>Carbon emissions and climate change are valid themes in this context.</li>
<li>The severity of any challenges is determined by the type of pollution and the scale/nature of the area affected and the vulnerability of people/places.</li>
<li>Political challenges include arriving at stakeholder agreement on any action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis of the severity of different types of challenges (environmental to political). Another approach might be to analyse the varying scale of each challenge (mortality may be relatively localized, with weaker dispersed effects evident on a larger scale).</p>
<p><em>Full marks may be obtained through use of a single case study provided there is sufficient analysis of the varying scale and severity of the associated challenges</em>.</p>
<p><strong>For 4–6 marks</strong>, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two problems / challenges / impacts.</p>
<p><strong>For 7–9 marks</strong>, expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a range of challenges created by one or more types of TBP</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> the varying severity and geographical scale of different TBP challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For 10–12 marks</strong>, expect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> of these traits.</p>

<p><em>Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to the paper 3 part B markbands</em>. <em>These can be found under the “Your tests” tab &gt; supplemental materials. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.</em></p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied themes</strong> (AO2) include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> (AO1) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>economic migration and its impacts on job availability</li>
<li>global shift and deindustrialization in high-income countries</li>
<li>negative economic consequences of outsourcing/offshoring for industrializing countries and communities, <em>eg</em> low rates of pay</li>
<li>tax avoidance by large corporations and offshoring of profits</li>
<li>the management of social and spatial inequalities which have grown in part because of global interactions / global shift.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>synthesize</strong> (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other) themes in a <strong>well-structured</strong> (AO4) way.</p>
<p>Good answers may additionally offer a <strong>critical evaluation</strong> (AO3b) of the statement, which discusses how the challenges are most severe in particular <span style="text-decoration: underline;">places</span> and at certain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scales</span> (<em>eg</em>, US Rust Belt state populations have suffered more than other areas of the US). Another approach might be to discuss how challenges lessen or become more severe over a longer <span style="text-decoration: underline;">timescale</span> (<em>eg</em>, post-industrial cities in high-income countries have been redeveloped and regenerated on account of global shift). A good discussion might conclude with a substantiated final judgement on the relative severity of different economic challenges.</p>
<p><strong>For 5–8 marks</strong>, expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes.</p>
<p><strong>For 9–12 marks</strong>, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes from the Guide</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> a critical conclusion (or on going evaluation) informed by geographical concepts and/or perspectives.</li>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the second most popular question. There were many satisfactory answers focused on proper examples of transboundary pollution. Candidates had often thoroughly revised the topic and used good supporting evidence of forest fires in Indonesia or issues arising from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Many answers were extremely detailed, making the scale and severity of the pollution very clear.</p>
<p>The best answers used the words scale and severity repeatedly, with sustained use of supporting evidence. They also understood the difference between an impact and challenge, allowing them to analyse the geopolitical and legal dimensions of transboundary pollution, not merely the numbers of deaths and asthma attacks.</p>
<p>It was disappointing to see so many candidates using the antiquated example of Chernobyl rather than the more contemporary Fukushima incident. The latter also lends itself well to analysis due to its coastal location and the way transboundary pollution occurred via the ocean, a global common. However, the Chernobyl TV series has understandably caught the imagination of a new generation of learners. If teachers continue to use this study, however, it would be good to encourage candidates to focus their learning on the geography of the pollution event rather than the sometimes lurid details of the meltdown incident.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Most candidates provided a satisfactory answer to this question by linking together three or four economic challenges or issues. Popular themes included trade conflict between the USA and China, the global shift of manufacturing work, tax avoidance by large companies and the costs of managing Covid-19.</p>
<p>Examples were often detailed, with some clear explanation of the challenges which particular governments or groups of citizens have experienced.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the role of global interactions was only implied rather than explicit. For example, candidates described the challenges that the USA and China now face because of increased tariffs. However, the link with global interactions was unclear. They were unable to explain the global interactions that gave rise to the latest wave of protectionism in the first place. In other words, only part of the story was being told.</p>
<p>Another weakness appearing in some answers was a tendency to write about business challenges while ignoring the phrase "countries and communities" in the question. It would have been self-evident to these candidates that businesses belong to particular countries and communities but it would have been helpful if they had justified the inclusion of material dealing with business challenges more securely.</p>

<p>Using examples, analyse ways in which international economic migration has been affected by political decision making.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
<p>“The economic gains associated with global development outweigh any cultural losses.” Discuss this statement.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Markscheme</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p><em>Marks should be allocated according to the paper 3 part A markbands</em>. <em>These can be found under the “Your tests” tab &gt; supplemental materials. </em></p>
<p>Political decision making encompasses the actions and laws of national governments (both host and source regions), along with other international frameworks for the regulation of economic migration, such as EU or Mercosur free migration and employment rules. International migration flows include those between close neighbours (such as the US and Mexico) but also much longer distance movements. The effects are likely to be explored mainly in terms of the size of flows but there are other possible dimensions (gender, age, skills, etc).</p>
<p><em>Do not credit analysis of remittance flows as this is not asked for. </em></p>
<p>Possible effects on migration attributable to governance at varying scales include:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual host country rules and laws for economic migration</li>
<li>MGO (e.g. EU) migration rules and decision of national governments to participate in multi-scale governance</li>
<li>possible role of source country government actions, decisions and conditions</li>
<li>the consequent size and other characteristics (e.g. gender, skills) of international/global migration flows</li>
<li>global governance of migration (UN frameworks – global compact for migration).<em><br></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis which clearly separates decision making about voluntary and forced migrants. Another approach might be to analyse political decision making at a range of scales (national government, MGOs, UN).<em><br></em></p>
<p><strong>For 4–6 marks</strong>, expect some outlining of one or two links between government policies and international migration flows. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>For 7–9 marks</strong>, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">either</span> two or more ways in which international migration has been affected by host country government decision making</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">or</span> political decision making in contrasting places (e.g. host <strong>and</strong> source country) or at varying scales (state governments <strong>and</strong> MGOs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For 10–12 marks</strong>, expect <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> of these traits.</p>

<p><strong>Global development</strong> may be seen as a holistic set of economic and societal changes. Development processes operating at national scales collectively comprise “global” human development, helped in part by transnational initiatives like the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). <strong><br>Economic gains</strong> may be measured collectively (global and national GDP per capita data) though these maybe unevenly spread between and within countries. <strong><br>Cultural losses</strong> may include harm to indigenous culture. Perspectives differ on this and not all losses may be seen as such by all people. <em><br></em></p>
<p><em>Economic losses and environmental changes should not be over-credited because the material is likely to be of marginal relevance to the task set</em>.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied</strong> themes (AO2) include <strong>knowledge </strong>and<strong> understanding</strong> (AO1) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>global economic growth, new superpowers and lending institutions (4.1)</li>
<li>the growth of global trade and connectivity (4.2)</li>
<li>links between human development and social changes (gender equality) (5.1)</li>
<li>microfinance and economic growth (5.1)</li>
<li>cultural diffusion between places (5.2)</li>
<li>changing cultures and cultural landscapes (5.2)</li>
<li>concerns with migration and cultural change (5.3)</li>
<li>anti-globalization / tribalization movements that value national self-determination ahead of economic connectivity (6.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>synthesize</strong> (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a <strong>well-structured</strong> (AO4) way.</p>
<p>Good answers may additionally offer a <strong>critical evaluation</strong> (AO3b) of the statement that discusses the extent to which economic gains exceed non-economic losses in different <span style="text-decoration:underline;">places</span>. Another approach might be to discuss the distribution of who gains most (and has lost most) at transnational, national or more local <span style="text-decoration:underline;">scales</span> (e.g., <span style="text-decoration:underline;">powerful</span> global elites may make disproportionately large economic gains while losing relatively little culturally). Another approach might be to critically discuss varying <span style="text-decoration:underline;">perspectives</span> on what constitutes a cultural loss.</p>
<p><strong>For 5–8 marks</strong>, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>For 9–12 marks</strong>, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">either</span> a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced themes from the Guide</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">or</span> a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical concepts and/or perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For 13–16 marks</strong>, expect <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> of these traits.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">b.</div>
</div>
<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Examiners report</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The best answers carefully adopted an analytical framework which looked at the question from a variety of perspectives. For example, in their introductions they identified that decisions are made by source and host country governments alike, and policies can be designed which either increase or stem the flow of migration. Additionally, decision making can be unilateral or multilateral depending on whether a national government has signed up to an intergovernmental agreement which allows for the free movement of people, as is the case for the European Union.</p>
<p>Candidates scoring 7-9 marks typically described two contexts in considerable detail. Popular case studies included the post-Brexit European Union and the US–Mexico border. It was pleasing to see widespread use of these contemporary case studies. Other widely-applied case study contexts included Singapore, UAE and Australia.</p>
<p>Candidates sometimes misspent their time by writing at length about global flows other than migration (notably remittances and international capital flows linked with TNCs). There were several accounts of Chinese polices aimed at encouraging inward investment which failed to make any meaningful link with international movements of people. Limited credit could still be awarded provided a satisfactory focus on political decision making had been sustained.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the least popular question on the examination paper, and many of the candidates who attempted it lacked a clear conceptual overview of what the phrase 'global development' means. Some candidates produced an essay comprising of two main case studies — for example, the colonization of Australia and China's treatment of Tibet. In both cases, the candidates correctly described some cultural losses and injustices. However, two historical case studies alone cannot provide a contemporary overview of global development in line with the aims of the question.</p>
<p>In contrast, the best answers adopted a broader global overview and were able to synthesize a range of themes including: the growth of the BRICs; the new global middle class; global trade and investment flows and patterns. They were also able to discuss the concept of cultural loss at a global scale, for example by documenting aggregate losses in the number of languages spoken around the world. The best answers also avoided spending too much time describing the contents of McDonald's menus and K-pop playlists.</p>

<p><em>Marks should be allocated according to the paper 3 part A markbands. These can be found under the “Your tests” tab &gt; supplemental materials.</em></p>
<p>Personal freedoms vary according to people’s identities (of gender, ethnicity, religion, age) and locations (democratic or non-democratic states, the presence / enforcement or absence of the rule of law in different rural or urban places). Participation in global interactions has many possible interpretations, including the freedom to use the internet and social media, and freedom to travel globally and internationally, freedom to trade or be involved in other internet / economic exchanges. Ideally, the focus should be on:</p>
<ul>
<li>people’s freedom to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">participate in global interactions</span> (“global freedoms”) rather than freedoms and rights in general.</li>
<li>the freedoms of individuals <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> societies (weaker answers may be less explicit about the personal dimension, <em>eg</em> by analysing state protectionism as a 'barrier' to global interactions but failing to show how people’s freedoms are affected).</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible reasons and place contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government and militia controls on personal freedoms in varying contexts.</li>
<li>National trade restrictions that can affect the different freedoms of people to establish businesses.</li>
<li>The lack of internet freedom in some places (which civil society groups may have highlighted).</li>
<li>The implications of surveillance on personal freedoms.</li>
<li>The impact of anti-globalization movements on the freedoms of supporters of globalization.</li>
<li>Poverty, gender and age as possible barriers to freedom.</li>
<li>Religion as a possible barrier, <em>eg</em> the USA’s travel ban on Muslims.</li>
<li>Not everyone has economic freedom to participate due to poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis of different kinds of freedom and possible barriers to these freedoms (political, economic, cultural, <em>etc</em>). Another approach might be to analyse different kinds of global interaction (internet use, tourism, trade) and barriers to these interactions in specific located countries and contexts.</p>
<p><strong>For 4–6 marks</strong>, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two instances of restricted “global freedoms”.</p>
<p><strong>For 7–9 marks</strong>, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span> different ways in which people may potentially participate in global interactions</li>

<p>The environmental impacts or risks include transboundary or more localized pollution, carbon emissions and climate change, and broader environmental issues such as biodiversity and ecosystem services losses. These impacts are generally accelerated for societies undergoing industrialization and demographic transition; an argument may be made that post-industrial societies have reduced environmental footprints, although this is debatable (due to the offshoring of pollution and carbon emissions). As “environmental impact” is a broad category, some impacts may lessen over time while others may not. The net environmental footprint of the global economy remains very high despite steps taken by some countries.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied themes</strong> (AO2) include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> (AO1) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>transboundary pollution affecting more than one country</li>
<li>localized pollution, including impact along shipping lanes</li>
<li>the carbon footprints of industrializing societies, linked with global flows of goods and resources</li>
<li>the offshoring of polluting manufacturing industries and the growth over time of environmentally destructive global agribusiness food production systems</li>
<li>reshoring for economic activity and local food sourcing, and the implications for carbon emissions</li>
<li>attempts by civil society organizations to raise environmental awareness, with positive results</li>
<li>TNC corporate responsibility frameworks with environmental protection</li>
<li>UN Sustainable Development Goals criteria</li>
<li>global trade slowdown since 2008 and the implications for the environment.</li>

<p>Good answers may <strong>synthesize</strong> (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other) themes in a <strong>well-structured</strong> (AO4) way.</p>
<p>Good answers may additionally offer a <strong>critical evaluation</strong> (AO3b) of the statement that discusses different kinds of environmental impacts at varying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scales</span> (global, national or more local patterns). Another approach might be to critically discuss the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">varying timescale</span> of any positive actions and impacts (some actions have achieved greater success than others in recent years). Another approach may be to critically discuss the extent to which developed countries have successfully brought about environmental improvements or have instead offshored their own carbon emissions by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interacting</span> with other <span style="text-decoration: underline;">places</span> (thanks to global shift and global agribusiness). A good discussion may conclude with a substantiated final judgment on the overall level of lessening (or not) at a global scale.</p>

<p><strong>Global superpowers</strong> are a diverse group of countries that have disproportionate power and influence compared with other states. Power has different facets – including economic, military (hard power), cultural (soft power) and geopolitical influence.</p>
<p>Alongside the USA, other significant global/regional powers include China, Russia and core EU states (Germany, France). The term “superpower” is contested and a case could can be made for further countries belonging to this category, including India, Brazil, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied</strong> themes (AO2) include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> (AO1) of the diverse challenges and opportunities associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the actions and strategies of TNCs domiciled in, for example, the USA and China, including inward investment, outsourcing, offshoring and glocalization [<em>Guide 4.2</em>]</li>
<li>lending and financial aid given to other countries by global superpowers [<em>Guide 4.2</em>]</li>
<li>global governance / global actions led by powerful countries e.g. action to tackle climate change [<em>Guide 2.3</em>]</li>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The majority of candidates possessed a clear understanding of how microfinance works. They were able to support their analysis with carefully-chosen evidence and contexts, such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh or KIVA's work in Kenya. Fewer knew the meaning of 'alternative trading network' as it appears in the geography guide. The example of Fairtrade was correctly used by some candidates; unfortunately, a significant number of candidates chose to write about a transnational corporations, such as Facebook, as their example of an alternative trading network. Happily, some credit could still be awarded in such cases provided a strong focus on community development was sustained throughout the answer.</p>
<p>Answers that attained the highest mark band provided detailed evidence of the work done by both microfinance organizations <em>and</em> alternative trading networks, while additionally sustaining a strong focus on the concept of community development. The very best answers thus explained how education, health and other sustainable development goals are met thanks to microfinance and Fairtrade. Many candidates wasted time documenting the weaknesses of microfinance and Fairtrade schemes. The question categorically did not ask for this.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Many candidates who answered question 1 appeared to have been attracted by the part (b) element, to judge by the way they began answered part (b) first before moving on to answer part (a). Most candidates produced a conceptually-informed account grounded in the terminology of hard power and soft power. Moreover, they provided a structured and systematic analysis of economic, political, environmental and cultural challenges and opportunities. Furthermore, their answers were usually well-balanced thereby demonstrating excellent discipline in the art of essay writing. Teachers are commended for developing all of these competencies in learners.</p>
<p>Weaker answers tended to view superpowers as a synonym for 'developed countries' and wrote in general about the challenges and opportunities which the developed countries of the world have created for what used to be called 'the global south'. While such material was usually relevant, a more specific AO2 focus on valid examples of superpower countries was expected for the award of high marks. Equally, candidates who wrote at great length about historic wars often failed to reach the top band. This was because they were unable to provide a wider synthetic understanding of the different ways in which power operates within contemporary global systems.</p>

<p><em>Marks should be allocated according to the paper 3 part A markbands</em>.&nbsp;<em>These can be found under the “Your tests” tab &gt; supplemental materials.</em></p>
<p>Global trade flows encompass movements of food, consumer goods, digital information sales (data) and touristic movements. National carbon footprint sizes are affected by both production and consumption of goods and services. In the context of global shift of industry, views differ on whether the carbon emissions created by the production of an item should be included as part of the footprint size for the producer or consumer country.</p>
<p>Possible ways in which global trade flows affect national carbon footprint sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries manufacturing high volumes of goods for export (e.g. China) have large carbon footprints.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Countries rearing large numbers of cattle or growing large amounts of crops (e.g. palm oil) may have high carbon/methane emissions.</li>
<li>Countries importing large volumes of fossil fuels subsequently use these fuels, emitting carbon.</li>
<li>The emissions created by the transport of goods may contribute to the national footprint of the country where the company is domiciled/headquartered.</li>
<li>Data flows can have surprisingly high footprints (e.g. bitcoin trading).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis of how different global flows/movements (different commodities, people, data) can all result in increased carbon emission sizes. Another approach might be to analyse, in turn, direct and indirect responsibility for carbon emissions (e.g. questioning whether the producer or consumer of goods is responsible).</p>
<p><strong>For 4–6 marks</strong>, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two different ways in which trade flows affect carbon footprints (most likely the analysis of two different types/aspects of trade flows).</p>
<p><strong>For 7–9 marks</strong>, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:</p>

<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">either</span> a range (two or more) of different global trade flows / economic activities</li>

<p>The <strong>cultural changes</strong> brought by globalization include changes to society, language and the landscape. Theories of cultural imperialism/Americanization/McDonaldization view the commodification of everyday life as a highly important cultural change. <strong>Urban and rural places</strong> in high-income, emerging and low-income countries alike may be exposed to different global flows and interactions, including tourism, trade, migration and social media. However, the degree of influence and its effects varies according to context.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied</strong> themes&nbsp;(AO2) include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> (AO1) of how:</p>
<ul>
<li>diaspora populations increase cultural diversity in places where they have become established, typically urban areas [<em>Guide 5.2</em>]</li>
<li>TNCs have exported cultural traits globally, including music, language, food and clothing. These changes may penetrate rural areas, not just urban areas [<em>Guide 5.2</em>]</li>
<li>a digital divide between urban and remote rural areas may limit the latter’s exposure to global flows [<em>Guide 4.3</em>]</li>
<li>some rural areas are home to groups who voluntarily opt out of globalization and prefer local sourcing of food etc. [<em>Guide 5.3</em>]</li>
<li>entire countries may be disconnected in some ways from global interactions: both their urban and rural areas may be resistant to cultural change as a result [<em>Guide 5.3</em>]</li>
<li>economic development may mean the differences between rural and urban core areas lessen in any case, which complicates the analysis [<em>Guide 5.1</em>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>synthesize</strong> (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other) themes in a <strong>well-structured</strong> (AO4) way.</p>
<p>Good answers may additionally offer a <strong>critical evaluation</strong> (AO3b) of the statement that discusses the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">processes</span> of cultural change in contrasting contexts (at different stages of development, or differing degrees of isolation). Another approach might be to discuss the extent of cultural change experienced by different <span style="text-decoration:underline;">places</span> with varying <span style="text-decoration:underline;">power</span> to resist particular global flows and interactions. A good discussion may conclude with a substantiated final judgement on the overall degree to which the statement is true given the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">diversity</span> of different urban/rural <span style="text-decoration:underline;">places</span>/types.</p>
<p><strong>For 5–8 marks</strong>, expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Examiners report</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the most popular question. The strongest answers typically employed three lines of analysis by focusing on (i) productive activities, (ii) the transport of goods and (iii) the possibility of good governance (actions to reduce emissions). At the top end, candidates recognized that carbon footprint measurement becomes difficult on account of the complexity of global supply chains. They understood that the carbon footprint of an iPhone, for example, is shared between many different countries where parts have been sourced from.</p>
<p>In the middle of the attainment range, candidates typically wrote more generally about the carbon emissions associated with a range of different types of activity or transport, including shipping and air traffic. Many struggled to make explicit links between these movements and the carbon footprints of particular countries. Instead, such answers typically asserted the container shipping has led to an increase in the size of carbon footprints for all countries. The weakest answers failed to maintain a sustained focus on carbon footprints sizes and drifted into long descriptions of the problems created by acid rain or transboundary pollution. A surprising number used 'ecological footprint' and 'carbon footprint' as interchangeable phrases throughout their entire answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be a good question for centres to make use of when preparing future classes for their examinations. Candidates could work together in groups to identify relevant and irrelevant information for inclusion in a model answer to this question.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The majority of candidates showed good understanding of the concept of culture and were able to apply their ideas in a relevant and meaningful way. The distinction between urban and rural places was clearly appreciated by all but a tiny minority, as might be expected given the importance and centrality of this taxonomy in the discipline of Human Geography. The question provided many opportunities for candidates to apply knowledge from across the width of their course. The most common route involved firstly writing about high levels of cultural diversity in cities due to the presence of transnational corporations and migrants. As a counterpoint to this, most candidates then argued that rural places do not experience cultural changes due to their isolation, or perhaps experience lesser cultural changes linked with the gradual diffusion of shrinking world technologies into rural areas. The best answers took care to distinguish between different types of rural place (in low-income or high-income countries, for instance, or more accessible and remote rural regions). A few answers had interesting things to say about the cultural conservatism of rural societies in some developed countries, especially the USA.</p>
<p>Given that this was the most popular question on the paper, it is very pleasing to see the overwhelming majority of candidates thoughtfully applying a well-chosen range of themes to the question being asked. As per the assessment objectives, essay questions are meant to provide a novel and unexpected context for the application of knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>The focus should be on what the SDGs’ criteria are, and why there is inherent value in this approach to setting goals using diverse criteria. The <strong>UN Sustainable Development Goals</strong> make use of 17 social, economic, environmental and political criteria. Their strength derives (i) from this holistic/multi-strand approach to understanding the <strong>human development process</strong> (i.e. their theoretical/philosophical/ontological merit) and (ii) the way they can be used as targets to guide and measure development <em>progress </em>(i.e. their practical/empirical value).</p>
<p>Possible strengths include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the inclusion of climate and biodiversity goals/targets</li>
<li>the highlighting of gender as an important issue</li>
<li>the primacy of poverty and hunger alleviation</li>
<li>the way countries and regions can monitor progress towards these goals</li>

<p>Opposition to globalization movements can take many forms. Economic challenges and injustices stemming from global shift, immigration or neo-colonialism may give rise to different forms and strengths of opposition. However, non-economic concerns with sovereignty and cultural identity are important foci for opposition too; also, environmental concerns such as climate change and biodiversity losses.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied themes</strong> <strong>(AO2)</strong> include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> <strong>(AO1)</strong> of:</p>
<ul>
<li>actual and perceived costs of economic migration for places (4.2)</li>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the least popular question. Candidates attempting it generally produced merit-worthy answers that competently addressed the two main elements of the question, namely the Sustainable Development Goals <em>and</em> their role in supporting human development (viewed at global or more local scales, or both). Some candidates approached the task from an ethical and moral viewpoint which analysed the merits of the goals which the United Nations has sought to pursue, including gender equality and greater care for the environment. Others approached the task from a more practical viewpoint by analysing the importance of formal development targets and goals (in order for progress to be made, and for governments to be held accountable).</p>
<p>A significant proportion of answers, however, were side-tracked in one of two ways, resulting in a lower mark than might have been expected. Firstly, some wrote at great length about the weaknesses of the Sustainable Development Goals, no doubt reflecting ways in which teaching and learning about the topic was originally carried out. Some candidates had perhaps rehearsed a model answer about the strengths and weaknesses of the Sustainable Development Goals as part of their revision. The question, however, directed candidates to focus their analysis differently, and this needed to be reflected in answers. Little credit could be awarded for material dealing with the weaknesses of the Sustainable Development Goals unless it also contained some creditworthy analysis of what is meant by the "human development process". Secondly, some candidates wrote at great length about a range of ways in which the United Nations supports human development in different countries and contexts. However, the material was only very loosely linked, if at all, with the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Here, candidates often neglected to define what "opposition" might mean at the outset of their essay. Political resistance to global interactions is a key theme appearing in the geography guide. This gives rise to many different opposition movements in varying countries and contexts. While such subject matter ought to have formed the basis for the discussion, many candidates treated the word "opposition" as if it were a synonym for "barrier". Candidates have previously been asked questions about barriers to globalization, and it was all too apparent that many viewed this year's Question 3(b) as an opportunity for them to reproduce a rehearsed answer from memory. Unfortunately, some themes, such as physical barriers to global interactions or poverty as a limiting factor, were largely irrelevant to the discussion and as a result only limited credit could be given.</p>
<p>In contrast, the strongest answers were well focused on opposition movements. Typically, candidates selected a range of geographical themes which sometimes serve as a basis for resistance to globalization, including: concerns over the environment and opposition to global agribusiness (with local food sourcing framed as an opposition movement); resistance to migration and cultural change (many candidates made effective use of case studies of Brexit and Donald Trump's politics); protests against neoliberal policies associated with lending by the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

<p>Cultural traits are the varied facets of a culture, including language, religion, cuisine, music, dress, <em>etc</em>. The most likely focus is national–cultural identity but ethnicity, religion and local cultures are creditable also.</p>
<p>The spread of cultural traits involves both the diffusion and subsequent adoption/use of new ideas, attitudes, tastes and behaviours. Culture spreads in numerous ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>diffusion of cultural traits carried by migrants and diaspora groups</li>
<li>ideas spread by social networks, data flows and “shrinking world” processes</li>
<li>TNC consumption networks and the cultural changes they bring</li>
<li>the past cultural imperialism of colonizing states, which led to the widespread diffusion and adoption of Western culture(s)</li>
<li>the sometimes complex ways in which cultural ideas spread from place to place on account of glocalization/hybridization processes (without which the adoption of new tastes/ideas/fashions/languages might not happen).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do not credit material which dwells on resistance to, or consequences of, cultural change. This is irrelevant to the clearly-directed question which has been asked</em>.</p>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a conceptually-informed analysis of how cultural spread (both diffusion and adoption) happens (utilizing concepts such as cultural imperialism, hybridization, <em>etc</em>).

<p><strong>Human development</strong>, like the MDGs/SDGs, includes economic, social/cultural and political elements. <strong>Globalization</strong> is similarly a multidimensional concept.

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The majority of candidates attempted this question. The evidence suggests they did so because cultural geography is a topic they find interesting and are therefore well-informed about. Many candidates wrote several pages describing in considerable depth the movements of migrant populations and the global spread of fast food and Disney films. In many cases, these answers scored between 7 and 9 marks. Although richly detailed, some responses lacked the conceptual awareness which tended to be a hallmark of top band answers. Marks of 10 and above were typically given to candidates who analysed not only how cultural traits are moved from place to place, but also how they subsequently "take root" (mirroring what happens when plant life spreads, cultural traits must also take root as part of the spreading process). The best answers recognized this and analyzed the varied ways in which the actual adoption of language, religion and other cultural traits is achieved in difficult places (alongside diffusion mechanisms). They were able to apply their knowledge of concepts such as cultural imperialism, globalization and soft power while carrying out a sophisticated analysis of the geographical spread of culture over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The majority of candidates demonstrated a clear understanding of what is meant by globalization and human development. Often, the essay began with an extended introductory paragraph defining the two ideas. Many candidates were able to gain between 9 and 12 marks by producing a series of linked paragraphs which explained a sequence of relationships. Popular themes included economic development (related to outsourcing and foreign direct investment) and aspects of social development (such as improved health and longevity, linked with the work of the World Health Organisation). Some candidates explained ways in which gender equality can be promoted by global flows of ideas and information, which is an important theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The command word "discuss" ideally required candidates to think critically and provide an evaluation of possible relationships. One way in which this was achieved involved discussing a reciprocal relationship, whereby the development of individual countries might allow them to participate more fully in globalization. Candidates who took this approach were thus able to discuss two different causal relationships (how globalization promotes human development; and in turn, how human development promotes globalization). Alternatively, some candidates chose to discuss positive and negative relationships between globalization ad human development. However, candidates sometimes struggled to put forwards a convincing argument that globalization may impact negatively on human development. This insecurity manifested itself in frequently-heard phrases such as "outsourcing of textile manufacturing to Bangladesh has led to industrial injuries which has interfered with the human development process". The use of the word "interfered" is symptomatic here of unsure argument. The maltreatment of workers in rapidly industrialising (and previously subsistence) societies does not provide evidence that national&nbsp;development is being "reversed" as many argued. A more thoughtful, critical and nuanced argument was required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A diaspora is a scattered population of common ancestry or heritage. Widely used examples include the global Indian, Chinese, Scottish, Irish, English, French and Jewish diasporas amongst many others. A country’s diaspora consists of its own overseas citizens, and citizens of other countries who are descended from earlier generations of migrants.</p>
<p>Possible influences of diaspora populations on cultural identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>By their presence, diaspora populations increase cultural diversity in particular places where they have become established.</li>
<li>Diaspora populations may help to modify the culture of particular places as part of a “melting pot” effect; cultural traits including music, language, food and clothing may all be modified by the arrival of migrants and establishment of diaspora communities (US culture can be analysed as a hybrid culture made up of traits contributed by many different diasporas).</li>
<li>The physical landscape can be modified by the construction of places of worship or specialist ethnic retailers and restaurants.</li>
<li>The cultural identity of source countries is affected too: tourism in countries such as Ireland caters to the expectations of visitors from the diaspora, possibly resulting in the fossilization of source countries’ cultures.</li>
<li>Influence may be far greater on particular neighbourhoods than it is on larger-scale cities or regions as a whole through the creation of ethnic villages (but ghettoization could limit cultural influence on other parts of the same local place).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis that clearly analyses different ways in which cultural identity is influenced, including a range of cultural traits.

<p>Communications technology includes the internet, email and social networks; it is necessary for the functioning of “the internet of things”, drones, artificial intelligence, <em>etc</em>. Human development refers not just to economic growth but also to broader social, cultural and political changes over time.

<p>Possibilities for analysis include the human development index (HDI), the gender equality index and GDP per capita or infant mortality. One approach might be to analyse two components of the HDI (<em>eg</em> life expectancy and literacy). Another approach might be to analyse the HDI in its entirety along with a second indicator, such as GDP per capita. Either approach is acceptable.</p>
<p><em>For full marks to be awarded, all of the points raised need not be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">explicitly</span> categorized as either validity or reliability issues.

<p><em>If more than two indicators are analysed, credit the two which are dealt with best</em>.</p>
<p>Possible issues associated with their use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the accuracy of the data (a reliability issue) and whether they are verifiable</li>
<li>the comparability of data between countries (a reliability issue), methodological issues (criticisms of GDP or HDI formulae) (a reliability issue)</li>
<li>the extent to which they genuinely show variations in development, for example HDI is widely viewed as a good measure because it takes into account three different variables (a validity issue)</li>
<li>varying perspectives on the genuine importance (validity) of what is being measured (<em>eg</em>, money, happiness, gender equality)</li>

<p>Popular indicators of development chosen by candidates included the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product per capita, the Gender Inequality Index and life expectancy. The majority provided satisfactory outlining of their chosen measures as part of their response. In some cases, a good analysis of validity and reliability was additionally provided. The former was usually dealt with by explaining the broad value and importance of each chosen measure. In particular, candidates pointed out that Gross Domestic Product per capita provides an important guide to the wealth of nations and the ability of governments to provide education and health care, which are universally valued services. The most popular themes pertaining to reliability included concerns with the accuracy of data and issues arising from the use of crude averaging. Weaker responses scoring between 4 and 6 marks showed little or no understanding of what is meant by validity and reliability in relation to development indicators.</p>

<p>This essay title lends itself well to synthetic writing: most candidates were able to link together a series of case studies showing why different countries or local places are more or less connected than others. The best answers selected their evidence carefully in order to provide a balanced review which gave equal weighting to physical and non-physical factors. Typically, an account was provided of landlocked states and isolated islands; these examples were then contrasted with politically-isolated societies. Weak answers (scoring between 5 and 8 marks) tended to lack specific details and instead presented generalized ideas about the difficulties of communicating with "mountainous places". In contrast, high-scoring answers reaching the top markband added a conceptual framework to their discussion. For example, some candidates discussed the validity of the statement at varying scales. They wrote about isolated countries such as North Korea but also included far more localized examples, including particular towns such as Todmorden in the UK, where local sourcing of food has meant relatively fewer food commodity movements. In this case, the reason for reduced connectivity is a civil-society sustainability movement, as opposed to physical geography.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the least popular question and it was not always effectively answered. Too many candidates seemed to have stopped reading the question at the word "used". They proceeded to explain how drones or other forms of surveillance can be used by governments to manage their own citizens and businesses without making any connections with the global dimension of the question.</p>
<p>Candidates who engaged fully with the question applied their knowledge in a far more satisfactory way. They correctly viewed technologies such as e-passports and firewalls as ways of managing global data and population flows. They were also explicit in their analysis of the <em>global risks</em> attached to these flows such as the spread of global terror cells or harmful computer viruses.</p>
<p>A minority of excellent answers linked the chosen technologies with the management of the global spread of Covid-19. Examiners credited a wide range of new technologies if they were satisfactorily linked with the concept of global risk management. It was, however, clear that a significant number of candidates attempting this question were unfamiliar with the portion of the course which this question examines. Instead, they were relying on everyday knowledge of computers, emails and firewalls.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Very few good answers to this question were produced. Typically, two weaknesses were apparent in the responses of candidates. Firstly, many wrote very little about physical factors. In some cases, candidates began by saying: "Physical factors are unimportant because globalization is the main reason". Any response that wilfully ignores the main focus of the question is always unlikely to reach the upper mark bands. Secondly, candidates confused the idea of cultural diversity in places with the idea of cultural difference between places. Thus, they explained how isolation, or an extreme environment might be linked with the development of a distinctive indigenous local culture. This is not evidence of cultural diversity, though.</p>
<p>The candidates who performed well in this question were usually able to discuss the extent to which geographic isolation or the presence of natural resources has encouraged or discouraged past or present migration flows and thus increased diversity.</p>

<p>Financial flows link places, societies and environments together to varying degrees and at varying scales: a good geographical response may explain links between particular urban or rural localities in addition to international linkages. One flow can generate multiple connections / links / interdependencies, which could be economic, social, cultural or political in character. Flows between places are sometimes asymmetric (one-way flows, for example the sending of aid) or more balanced (two-way flows, for example remittance flows accompany migration in the other direction, with both flows connecting together host and source countries).</p>
<p>Possible themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by transnational corporations (TNCs) — links are economic but may become cultural too, as cultural traits are exchanged alongside flows of money and commodities (particular local places may become highly connected e.g. export processing zones)</li>
<li>global trade in financial services — particular trading centres / cities / hubs (Zurich, Singapore) may become especially well connected (flows may also connect two hubs within the same country (New York and Los Angeles)</li>
<li>international aid, loans and debt relief – aid may be targeted at particular places inside countries e.g. disaster relief aid flows; the connections are economic but also political (this can be a soft power strategy used by some states to build friendship with other countries)</li>
<li>global/international flows of migrant remittances — linking together local-scale places (e.g. particular cities and rural villages) within different countries.</li>

<p><strong>Environmental costs</strong> stem from industrialization, agribusiness, transport, urbanization — i.e. the totality of economic growth and development. <strong>Global economic growth</strong> can be viewed as the rise over time in global gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and increased industrialization/urbanization. <strong>Social gains</strong> of economic growth include improved life expectancy, health and diet; access to education; and changing social attitudes e.g. empowerment of women and minority groups.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em">Examiners report</h2>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This question was well-answered in the majority of cases. Candidates analysed the statement using case studies of financial flows, sometimes augmented with their own personal knowledge of cryptocurrencies or online purchasing. The best answers used evidence well and were fully focused not only on financial flows but also on connectivity between places. Remittances were written about by many. There was also widespread analysis of outsourcing investment and the role that the internet plays supporting FDI strategies by TNCs. Wherever possible, credit was awarded for work which focused on legitimate global flows, such as sales of goods and trade movements, that in turn generate transfers of profit or sales payments.</p>
<p>The most thoughtful answers correctly developed their responses in ways which highlighted the connectivity between different places that financial flows often foster. For example, the best answers dealing with remittances were able to explain that financial connectivity between migration host and source countries can be a starting point for cultural and even political connectivity. Other good answers analysed the concept of place at a variety of geographic scales. For example, remittance flows between eastern and western Europe have helped to connect individual countries together within the European Union; at the same time, remittance flows can link together rural and urban localities within a single country.</p>
<p>The two examples below are typical of the contrast which existed between answers reaching the top mark band (10-12) and answers which did not [<em>Using examples, explain how two types of financial flow connect different places together</em>]. While example B contains more recalled migration facts than example A, it does not analyse connectivity between places nearly as well. In example B, the words "place" and "connection" are not used at all.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example A (extract from response reaching the 10-12 mark band)</span></p>
<p>"India receives billions of dollars of remittances from its diaspora population of 23 million people each year. Remittances sent from local places like east London can then be used by the migrants' families to help pay for their mobile and phone services, like those provided by BharatNet in rural India. This further increases connectivity between different local places, allowing even more exchange of ideas and information."</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example B (extract from response reaching the 7-9 mark band)</span></p>
<p>"Another major financial flow today would be remittances. There is an influx of people migrating to different countries where there is higher pay. This is prevalent in the Middle East especially in Qatar with its hosting the 2022 World Cup. They have attracted many migrants to work in the construction industry. The migrants who moved to Qatar contribute to its economy. Every year billions of dollars are earned in this way."</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This question asked if the environmental costs of global economic growth outweigh the social gains. The best answers did three important things. Firstly, they provided a discussion focused on environmental costs and social gains without deviation into lengthy discussion of environmental benefits and social costs, neither of which are strictly part of the discussion. Secondly, they focused on the global dimension of the question, for example by writing about the global-scale growth of the middle class, or global progress towards the Millennium Goals and Sustainable Development Goals. Thirdly, they provided a proper evaluative conclusion, for example by noting that some of the economic harm done may yet be reversible if action is taken quickly enough (and the social gains of education mean there are more scientists than ever before who can work to provide solutions). Whatever position is taken, the hallmark of a high-scoring answer is an evaluative discussion which goes beyond simple listing of impacts and can provide a more sophisticated weighing-up of evidence.</p>
<p>In contrast, weaker answers omitted any global-scale overview of the issues and instead listed a series of local environmental problems. Popular themes included air pollution and oil spills. Often, there was very little explicitly said about social gains other than rising incomes. Some candidates provided lengthy descriptive case studies dealing with social challenges created by the global economy, such as the Rana Plaza disaster. Little credit could be awarded to these studies if they were presented as standalone items with no justification for their inclusion in a response that is meant to focus on social gains.</p>

<p>Trade restrictions include tariffs, quotas, sanctions, etc. The most likely foci are protectionism and resource nationalism (in relation to, for example, rare earths). Contemporary examples could include the USA, China or Bolivia.</p>
<p>Emphasis should be placed on the reasons why national governments seek to restrict trade with some or all nations. These may include:</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Most candidates who attempted this question achieved a satisfactory mark in the 7-9 band. They did so by referencing two or more clearly explained reasons for trade restrictions. Popular themes included: </p>
<p>the need to protect domestic industries from competition; geopolitical tensions; and moral and ethical reasons (for example, the imposition of trade sanctions in response to human rights abuses).</p>
<p>The highest scoring answers provided sustained evidence to support their chosen reasons, with many candidates making topical reference to recent trade disputes between the USA and China. A minority of answers provided detailed accounts of some unusual examples of trade restrictions, such as the fact that chewing gum cannot be imported into Singapore.</p>
<p>Weaker responses typically failed to identify specific reasons for trade restrictions. They wrote — often at some length — about problems associated with particular types of trade, such as high environmental costs. However, the account lacked an explicit focus on the key word "reasons". Additionally, some answers drifted into a description of migration or investment flows (both of which are sometimes linked with trade patterns but are not the same thing). Some AO2 credit was given in such cases if a strong focus on governance (and the reasons for restrictions) was evident, thereby ensuring that a partial attempt had been made to apply knowledge and understanding to the question asked.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Most candidates were able to distinguish between 'local' and 'global' challenges. Popular 'local' themes included: the loss of employment (due to ICT-supported outsourcing); governance challenges in places where social media use has become linked with increased civil society campaigning (for example, Capitol Hill in the USA); online bullying and manipulation of young people by posts from social media platforms. Popular 'global' themes included: international espionage; tax evasion and identity theft; online recruitment by international militia groups; and the idea that a digital divide exists between some countries, regions and groups of people at both global and local scales. Good answers took care to link all of the chosen themes explicitly with the facilitating role played by the internet and social media. Weaker answers were typically less explicit and described the injustices or problems caused by drone missiles or 3-D printers but without making much reference to digital data flows.</p>
<p>Some answers were largely anecdotal and lacked use of geographical terminology or concepts. In contrast, stronger answers linked their examples and case studies with a range of recognizably learned concepts such as sovereignty, identity, the shrinking world or cultural imperialism. These answers were often extremely interesting and conceptually rich.</p>
<p>A minority of candidates ignored the precise wording of the question and chose to also write at length about the benefits which some technologies bring. Sometimes credit could be given for this. For example, a candidate might explain how problems can arise from social media and then reflects on mitigation measures which could tackle those problems while ensuring that the technology's benefits are still enjoyed by people. This is a creditable evaluative approach. In contrast, material which dealt <em>only</em> with the benefits of a particular technology (such as e-passports) had to be marked as irrelevant in the context of this question.</p>

<p><em>Do not over-credit a detailed discussion of the actions of non-governmental stakeholders (TNCs, NGOs, etc.) unless the account is logically linked with government actions and attitudes (e.g. discussion of how governments allow or disallow FDI, free trade etc.)</em>.</p>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Question 1 was by far the most popular on the paper. The overwhelming majority of candidates experienced no difficulty obtaining a middle or upper mark-band score through the delivery of a satisfactory account of hostility against migration in one or more countries. Great use was made of contemporary examples and political movements in the UK, USA and France especially. The best responses were accurate, detailed and were able to engage with the issues in an academic and objective way.</p>
<p>There was a tendency among some weaker candidates to offer more sensationalist, generalized and less well-evidenced accounts of the politics of Donald Trump or the Brexit political movement. In a small number of cases, candidates wrote about xenophobic nationalism so carelessly that it raised concerns that these might be their own views rather than objective reporting of hate-fuelled politics. Candidates are reminded to take great care when carrying out an analysis of sensitive issues.</p>
<p>The main reason why relatively few candidates obtained full marks in this question was neglect of the phrase "recent and widespread rise" in the question. Too often, answers were focused on events in one or two countries and whilst the detail was excellent no explicit mention of the wider global context was made. The best candidates, in contrast, understood that the question was providing them with an opportunity to analyse how, in recent decades, globalization has accelerated at such a rapid rate that many individuals and societies have felt compelled to react against it. Hence the rise of populist movements is a <em>recent and widespread</em> phenomenon.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This question was focused on global financial flows and governments. Popular themes included international aid, the imposition of taxes and tariffs, and legal frameworks for foreign direct investment, including the establishment of special economic zones. Together, these three themes were sufficient for a high mark to be awarded provided sufficient evidence had been provided and a strong focus maintained on the role of government.</p>
<p>Weaker candidates typically failed to provide much evidence or to maintain a strict focus on the actions of governments. Thus, they were able to write about businesses and their investments overseas but could say very little about how this was linked with government actions. Similarly, candidates who discussed import taxes affecting trade often wrote at great length about movements of commodities without mentioning the reciprocal financial flows which trade generates.</p>
<p>The best answers reaching the highest mark band were able to provide a proper discussion of what might be meant by "the actions of government" - for example, they were able to establish a link between policies designed to manage migration and the <em>linked</em> impact this can have on remittance flows. They were therefore able to distinguish between <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> effects on financial flows. In some cases, the best answers explored government actions at different geographic scales, ranging from city councils through to the European Union and other intergovernmental organizations. Finally, some very good answers<br>discussed the power balance between the actions of governments and businesses, for example in relation to tax havens.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural diversity</strong> refers to a heterogeneous population and the presence of different religious, linguistic, ethnic groups in a particular place, whereas <strong>cultural hybridity</strong> refers to a “mix” (or melting pot) of cultural forms, including globalized products, art forms and landscapes. The two may be linked insofar as cultural diversity (the presence of multiple cultural traits and traditions) creates the potential for mixing and hybridity in the absence of constraints (such as apartheid-style segregation of ethnic groups).</p>
<p>Possible analytical themes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>different aspects of cultural diversity, including the traits of language, religion, food, music etc.</li>
<li>places where cultural diversity is high, including global hubs / world cities</li>
<li>different instances of cultural hybridity, including music, languages</li>
<li>cultural hybridity as a by-product of economic strategy, i.e. glocalization of products by TNCs</li>
<li>the growth of cultural hybridity in some culturally diverse places on account of more groups mixing with one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>apply</strong> (AO2) a <strong>wider range</strong> of knowledge and understanding (AO1) in a <strong>well-structured</strong> way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis of different facets of cultural diversity and hybridity (food, music, etc.). Another approach might be to analyse ways in which diversity and hybridity are linked in particular places and contexts.</p>
<p><strong>For 4–6 marks</strong>, expect some outlining of cultural diversity and/or cultural hybridity. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>For 7–9 marks</strong>, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">either</span> different examples of cultural diversity and cultural hybridity</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">or</span> how the two concepts are linked (how diversity gives rise to hybridity).</li>

<p><strong>The largest TNCs</strong> are global-scale businesses spanning all industrial sectors(from agribusiness to technology, e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google <em>aka</em> FANG). <strong>Global power</strong> is a broad concept encompassing both hard and softforms of domination, ranging from military power to cultural and ideological influence (hegemony). The world’s <strong>national governments</strong> belong to countries ranging in scale from small island territories and city-states to large industrialized superpowers (USA). Many have significant military and economic strength. Some small countries may have great global influence but in narrow ways.</p>
<p>Possible <strong>applied</strong> themes (AO2) include <strong>knowledge and understanding</strong> (AO1) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>global core and periphery patterns (1.1)</li>
<li>powerful countries and global groups (4.1)</li>
<li>roles of countries and TNCs in global networks and flows (4.2)</li>
<li>FDI and outsourcing by TNCs, including detailed examples (4.2)</li>
<li>TNCs and their social responsibility frameworks (5.1)</li>
<li>cultural landscape and built environment changes (5.2)</li>
<li>campaigns against TNCs by citizens (5.3)</li>
<li>tax-avoidance strategies of TNCs (6.1)</li>
<li>role of national governments in global risk management (6.3).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good answers may <strong>synthesize</strong> (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a <strong>well-structured</strong> (AO4) way.</p>
<p>Good answers may additionally offer a <strong>critical evaluation</strong> (AO3b) of the statement that examines the exercise of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">power</span> at varying <span style="text-decoration:underline;">scales</span> (e.g. TNC/state government influence over global, regional or more local issues). Another approach might be to critically examine how power remains concentrated in particular <span style="text-decoration:underline;">places</span> in many different countries (state capitals, global hubs). Another approach might be to discuss how far either TNCs or national governments can drive different <span style="text-decoration:underline;">processes</span> such as human development or global political, culture and normative changes.</p>
<p><strong>For 5–8 marks</strong>, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>For 9–12 marks</strong>, expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">either</span> a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced themes from the Guide</li>

<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>This was the most popular question. The majority of candidates gained a 7-9 mark or higher by demonstrating a clear understanding of both concepts, supported with relatively detailed evidence. The majority of candidates provided a focused answer which clearly explained how the two concepts may become linked, typically because diverse places become 'melting pots' where hybrid forms of culture may develop over time. Popular themes included hybrid forms of food and music in contexts where a 'cultural conversation' has occurred. </p>
<p>The best answers went further with their response by analyzing the <em>strength</em> of the links in different contexts. Some candidates acknowledged that the links would not necessarily be strong in contexts where different ethnic groups live plural lifestyles and do not mix together significantly. Weaker answers typically did not explain any links in a convincing way. For example, one case study was provided of cultural diversity in a world city along with a second case study of a McDonald's menu. These two standalone case studies (with no links written about) provided only a partial answer to the question which had been asked.</p>
<p>A minority of candidates were confused about the meaning of one or both concepts. A relatively common mistake was to view cultural hybridity as a synonym for cultural imperialism. Candidates wrongly wrote about Westernization and the erosion of local cultures as evidence of cultural hybridity.</p>
<div class="question_part_label">a.</div>
</div>
<div class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>The best answers provided a systematic discussion of different facets of power, including economic, cultural and political influence. They worked systematically through these facets, comparing and contrasting the power of TNCs and governments at each step. Often, this discussion was supported by the use of subject-specific terminology. A minority of candidates provided an advanced evaluation in which they viewed the statement as a 'false dichotomy' and argued that TNCs often work <em>with</em> governments to enhance the power (and rewards) of both parties, for example in the argument that Disney and Microsoft contribute to the soft power of the USA which in turn benefits the US government.</p>
<p>The weaker answers tended to provide a lengthy description of the actions of one or two TNCs. They asserted that the ability of TNCs to act in certain ways is symptomatic of global power and influence. They then proceeded to write a separate account focused on the military power of named governments. All of which led eventually to the simple conclusion that TNCs and governments both have power. The overall character of such essays was descriptive with only very basic evaluation demonstrated.</p>
